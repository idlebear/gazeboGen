# GazeboGen
## A simple test package for experimenting with ROS builds, Cmake, submodules, and generating GazeboWorlds

A small project intended to test the generator library found in:

    https://github.com/idlebear/octomap_to_gazebo_world.git
    
Simple stuff, but fun all the same. Maybe, the gen tool will eventually grow up, but that's another repository...
